            p We started with targeting kids between the ages of 13 - 17 on Facebook and on G&R Ad network, with not so flattering results. It didn’t take long enough to figure out what went wrong. We changed our approach and targeted parents instead - adjusted targeting in G&R as well. CTR (Click Through Rate) among parents was 3x than that of children and CPC was half of that of children's’.

            p We received a few creatives from Champs21 team and created multiple versions of the same design (changed color scheme and size for banner ads). We tested out visuals and CTAs (Call To Action) to optimize budget accordingly.

            p We drove 2,601 downloads of the app within 30 days and came to a conclusion that kids aren’t as much interested in becoming smarter as their parents want them to be. 268K people were reached, with 837K impressions being created and 19K clicks. Cost per user acquire or download was USD .70 (CPA).
