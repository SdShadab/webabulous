          p We met Preetom during the ‘What’s the best burger in town?’ fad. The burgers were all the rage and Preetom was our favorite! So we wanted to justify why Preetom was the best in town. How? Reviews speak louder than sponsored updates and ads!

        br
        p The campaign was targeted to foodies, youthful audience and the glory of burgers. We took mouthwatering photos of the flagship burger and built content around it. We created a series of product contents to communicate the offer. Images were aided with bright colors and playful typography. We also created engagement contents about anatomy of burgers and talk about how and where the best burgers are made. We shared user generated contents and invited people to share the love; and they did. Overall, it was a delicious ordeal.
