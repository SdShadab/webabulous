        p We created contents which hinted very subtly on Aarongâ€™s e-commerce launch. These contents indirectly spoke about the advantages of shopping online. Overall purpose was to create a vibe that something big was about to happen. Also, there were general contents with a CTA (Call To Action) to participate in the contest.
